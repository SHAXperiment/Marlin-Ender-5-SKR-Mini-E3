# Marlin Configurations for Ender-5 (Mainboard BTT SKR Mini E3 v2.0)
Firmware Marlin (bugfix branch and stable versions) for Ender 5 with SKR-Mini-E3 v2.0 and TFT3.5

The configuration is for 16 microsteps, later i will add a configuration with 32 microsteps.

__Attention: Old models of Ender 5 have 400 steps/mm at Z-Axis, my model is very new and got 800 steps/mm (they renewed the z-axis).__

Since the firmware that BIGTREETECH provides is not working for my Ender 5 (the Z-Axis moves the wrong way and the steps are incorrect for my Ender 5),
i made my own configuration. My Ender 5 has a different Z-Axis and needs 800 steps so this is the most important change in this configuration.
Also i added the BIGTREETECH TFT3.5, here it's important to use CR10 display and not full graphics display, since it's not supported from the firmware.

At the moment it's not possible to use the stable release since the mainboard is not supported yet.

I also added manual bed leveling with mesh leveling. Worked for me and the leveling was very easy.

I used Visual Studio Code with Platform IO to compile and then put the firmware.bin on the SD-Card.
Put it into the mainboard (SKR Mini not the original!) and it updates the firmware on the next start.

## Marlin 2.0 

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 introduces a layer of abstraction so that all the existing high-level code can be built for 32-bit platforms while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility. Retaining AVR compatibility and a single code-base is important to us, because we want to make sure that features and patches get as much testing and attention as possible, and that all platforms always benefit from the latest improvements.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
